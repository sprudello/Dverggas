# Privacy Policy

## 1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and sell your data. By accessing and using our platform, you agree to the practices outlined below. If you disagree, please close the browser window and reconsider your life choices.

## 2. Personal Data Collection
We collect the following types of personal data from users:
- Name, email address, and contact details.
- Payment information.
- Browsing history, shopping preferences, and wishlist items.
- Favorite Categories (yes, we’re that thorough).

## 3. Data Usage
We use your data to:
- Process your transactions and deliver no goods.
- Provide personalized shopping experiences.
- Spam your inbox with offers that we think you *won't* be interested in.

## 4. The "Data Sale" Clause
By using our platform, you agree that we may:
- Sell your data to third-party marketers, data brokers, or that one guy we met at a conference who said he’s “into data.”
- Trade your information for coupons, free samples, or exclusive access to a secret VIP lounge (disclaimer: the VIP lounge may or may not exist).
- Share your browsing habits with advertisers because, hey, they’ve got bills to pay too.

## 5. User Responsibilities
As a user, you are responsible for:
- Accepting that your data will likely end up on a marketing spreadsheet somewhere.
- Keeping your passwords secure, though we may not.
- Buying more stuff from us so we have more data to sell (help us help you!).

## 6. Data Retention
We retain your data for as long as you continue to shop with us or until we get bored, whichever comes first. If you stop using the platform, we reserve the right to keep your data until we’ve squeezed every last penny out of it.

## 7. Your Rights
You have the right to:
- Request a copy of your data (we may or may not charge for printing costs).
- Complain about data use, but we might put more work into selling your data.
- Opt out of marketing emails, though we’ll probably send you a “sorry to see you go” email.

## 8. Changes to this Policy
We may update this privacy policy at any time, and you’ll probably find out about it when it’s too late. But don’t worry, it’s just business.

*Thank you for trusting us with your data. If you're not happy about it, you can try reading our policy again—spoiler alert: it won't change. But hey, our legal team is ready for your strongly worded email. In the meantime, just remember: everyone else has already accepted it.*
