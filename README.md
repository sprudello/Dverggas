- In this you can copypaste the MySQL Scripts located in the db folder. (You have to do it in the order below.)

    - Firstly, take the script from [tables.sql](https://github.com/sprudello/Dverggas/blob/main/db/tables.sql).

- For the second 2 files you first have to go into the Dverggas Database and then again go into the SQL section. You should see a ``Run SQL query/queries on database Dverggas``

    - Secondly, take the script from [categories.sql](https://github.com/sprudello/Dverggas/blob/main/db/categories.sql)
    - Thirdly, take the script from [products.sql](https://github.com/sprudello/Dverggas/blob/main/db/products.sql)
    - You can ignore connection.php

- If all the scripts were successfully executed, then you can move to [localhost/dverggas](http://localhost/dverggas/) and test out the website.
